# :v: shifumi

This goal's project is to make an AI that can play shifumi, with a little tkinter interface.

The objective is not to make the best AI of the world, but just to make an AI that can know what is your next move by analyzing data stored in csv.

## :books: Python imports
For this project we use :
- pandas: 
    - for dataframe
- numpy: 
    - for array
- matplotlib: 
    - for graphic
- tkinter: 
    - for interface

## :dizzy: Conventionnal commit
We use this syntax for each commit : `<key>: <message>`.

Example:
- feat: new project
- fix: fix troubles
- delete: remove useless files

> There is more key word but these 3 are the most important.
